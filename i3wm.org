** commands & configurations

   list of commands that i used to configure i3wm
   
   * default dark mode in i3wm 

     set in  ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini 

     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     [Settings]
     gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme=1
     #+END_SRC

   * keyboard layout
     to set keyboard layout with *win* and *space* key to switch layout.

     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     exec "setxkbmap -layout us,ar"
     exec "setxkbmap -option 'grp:win_space_toggle'"
     #+END_SRC
   

   * redshift configurations
     for more info you can read the redshift docs

     #+BEGIN_SRC
     [redshift]
     location-provider=manual
     adjustment-method=randr

     [manual]
     lat=30.043489
     lon=31.235291
     #+END_SRC


   * set default app to open specific file

     first getting the *MIME* type by typing in the terminal

     ~xdg-mime query filetype {file}~

     ex: 
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     xdg-mime query filetype Ahmed\ Mohamed.pdf

     output: application/pdf
     #+END_SRC

     add in the *~/.config/mimeapps.list* the filetype (if doesn't exist) and 
     the default app for that file.
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     [Default Applications]
     ...
     application/pdf=org.gnome.Evince.desktop;firefox-esr.desktop
     ...
     #+END_SRC

     you can find the list of installed apps in  ~/usr/share/applications~

     *hint*: to get the default app for specific file either form ~mimeapps.list~ or by the following
     command

     ~xdg-mime query default application/pdf~

     if you get default app different than the one in ~mimeapps.list~ check
     the following file ~~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list~ and also make sure
     that your added the mimetype and the app under *[Default Applications]*.

   * configure mc *midnight commander*

     copy the file mc.ext to configuration folder (if not exists),
     mc loads configurations from that file.
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     cp /etc/mc/mc.ext  ~/.config/mc/
     #+END_SRC

     
     * keep Midnight Commander running after you open a file

        add ~&~ at the end of the *open* command related to the file type in
        the ~mc.ext~ file

        example of pdf in my ~mc.ext~ file:

        #+BEGIN_SRC
        ...
        # PDF
        type/^PDF
          Open=/usr/lib/mc/ext.d/doc.sh open pdf &
          View=%view{ascii} /usr/lib/mc/ext.d/doc.sh view pdf
        ...
        #+END_SRC
